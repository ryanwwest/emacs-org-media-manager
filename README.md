# Org Mode Image Manager

This repository comprises functionality that allows the use of Emacs Org-mode and images in a more efficient way. Specifically, it adds keybindings to paste image data from the clipboard as well as garbage collection of image files that were previously added and then deleted.

The code is intended to be functional when possible, though some of the I/O and interfacing with the operating system files make it hard to do eveyrwhere.

Much of the  code for this is in custom.el, though some is also in config.el. Some test files are in the directory in this repository. This repo also contains some other emacs config.
